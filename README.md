# NLP0 (master)
First NLP project.

### Motivation
This is a learning project. Some of the things we aim to learn are in the following not exhaustive list:

1. To collaborate in a version control environment.
2. To write `.md` documents.
3. To get familiar with simple NLP methods.
4. To improve our coding habbits, specially with Python. 

### Useful (?) links

This very small and concise [GUIDE](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) is helping me this very moment to write this `.md` document.

About doing NLP with Python, I found a simple to follow [GUIDE](https://realpython.com/nltk-nlp-python/). I haven't reproduced any of their code, but I liked the explanation so far.
