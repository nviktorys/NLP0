### Natural Language Processing with Disaster Tweets
Kaggle project - https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/nlp-getting-started/overview/description

Twitter has become an important communication channel in times of emergency.
The ubiquitousness of smartphones enables people to announce an emergency they’re observing in real-time. Because of this, more agencies are interested in programatically monitoring Twitter (i.e. disaster relief organizations and news agencies).
But, it’s not always clear whether a person’s words are actually announcing a disaster.

In this project, we will build a machine learning model that predicts which Tweets are about real disasters and which one’s aren’t. The dataset contains 10,000 tweets that were hand classified.
